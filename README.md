# DIP_Image_Merging
the codes for image merging to get hgher resolution and better spectral information. 
Since the rgb2hsi is not availabe in python, it should be imlemented in matlab with the out put of image registration and reference image.

The Code for difference detection takes images from same sesors for better information retaintation .
hence here no image registration is performed.
It is basicallly swap of channels.


for stiching part specify the inputs in input folders.
